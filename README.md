# Welcome!ðŸ‘‹:

Thanks for checking out this Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.
# Problem Statement:

The challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it to look as close to the design as possible.

# Features List:

1. The game is designed for two players; one is you as a player, and the other is your computer.
2. There will be simultaneous turns given to you and your computer. As soon as you choose one option for yourself, i.e., rock or paper, your opponent will also strike at the same time.
3. Show the respective scores on the screen for computer and humans.
4. Different messages have been displayed on the screen as per the win of the participants.
5. There is a rules section at the bottom right, so as soon as you click on it, a pop-up will open, and you need to write the basic rules of the game. There is also a close button to close the pop-up.
6. You need to store the scores in local storage and make sure that the scores are not lost when reloading the page.
7. You also need to show a celebration animation if the human wins against the computer.

# Rules
If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the computer gains one point.
